Partitions and consumer group scenarios understanding

Only 1 consumer from consumer group will be able to read from a partition of a topic and a one cosumer from a consumer group can read multiple partitions.
A topic can have multiple partitions and One topic can have n consumers.

There should not be more partition than that of the number of consumer in consumer group

Ex: 5 consumer in a consumer group

	1 partition -> 1 consumer from consumer group will be active and 4 will be idle
	3 partition -> 3 consumer from consumer group will be active and 2 will be idle
	6 partition -> 5 consumer from consumer group will be active and 1 will be overloaded for reading 2 partitions.

				 [t1,p6,0]
				 [t1,p1,1]
				 [t1,p6,1]


A topic should not have more partition than that of the number of consumer in the/a consumer group.


Offset =[ topic, partition,index] based on which consumer will ask a new message.

Scenario 1:
There are 2 partition of a topic and one consumer in one consumer group.

Behaviour:
One consumer from grp will read all messages.
topic t1 -> p1 p2

cg1 -> [t1,p1,0]
	 [t1,p2,0]
	 [t1,p1,1]
	 [t1,p2,1]

Scenario 2: There is only one partition and 2 consumer in a consumer group.

Behaviour:
only one consumer will be able to read the message

topic -> t1 , p1

cg1 -> [t1,p1,0]
       [t1,p1,1]

cg2-> idle mode

Scenario 3: There are 2 partitions and 3 consumers in a consumer group, where the 2nd consumer dies after reading 1 message.

Behaviour:

cg1 -> [t1,p1,0]
       [t1,p1,1]

cg2-> [t1,p2,0]
      [t1,p2,1]

cg3 -> idle mode

---- When cg2 dies---

cg1 -> [t1,p1,0]
       [t1,p1,1]

cg3 -> [t1,p2,2]



2 partition between john and jenny over chat application

hi ->p1
hello -> p1
how are you -> p2


hi
how are you
hello




there should not more partition than that of the number of consumer in consumer group
